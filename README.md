# Ludus
Ludus is a gamification framework for Github and Trello. It can also be extended to other version control and project management tools like Gitlab, Jira etc. This application has been configured with 11 events and 15 badges currently. You can design and contribute more events or badges as per your needs.</br> 
The Ludus project was completed as a part of the Summer Internship program at **Red Hat Inc**.

## Motivation

According to TalentLMS Gamification at Work Survey 2018, about 85 % of employees agreed that they would spend more time on the gamified software. Our motivation behind Ludus is to bring a positive transformation in the software industry by the gamification of Version Control and Project Tracking tools.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live OpenShift Cluster.

### Deployment

To deploy Event Listener application on an OpenShift cluster use the following command with required parameters:
        
```
oc process -f openshift/ludus.event_listener.deployment.template.yaml -p GITHUB_URL=<github_url> KAFKA_TOPIC=<kafka_topic_name> KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<kafka_bootstrap_server>| oc apply -f -
```

- `GITHUB_URL`: The url of the forked github repository of ludus. The default is https://github.com/akhil-rane/Ludus.git

- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: The name of the kafka topic where event lister will publish the incoming events. The default is ludus_awarder

- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER`: The hostname and port of the the kafka bootstrap server. The valid format is hostname:port


To deploy Awarder application on an OpenShift cluster use the following command with required parameters:
        
```
oc process -f openshift/ludus.awarder.deployment.template.yaml -p GITHUB_URL=<github_url> KAFKA_TOPIC=<kafka_topic_name> KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<kafka_bootstrap_server> AWARDER_NAME=<awarder_name> AWARDER_PORT=<awarder_port> EVENTS_TABLE_NAME=<events_table_name> BADGES_TABLE_NAME=<badges_table_name> | oc apply -f -
```

- `GITHUB_URL`: The url of the forked github repository of ludus. The default is https://github.com/akhil-rane/Ludus.git

- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: The name of the kafka topic where event lister will publish the incoming events. The default is ludus_awarder

- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER`: The hostname and port of the the kafka bootstrap server. The valid format is hostname:port

- `AWARDER_NAME`: The name of the awarder application. This should be unique per kafka cluster. You can scale it to distribute event processing load

- `AWARDER_PORT`: The port number of the awarder application

- `EVENTS_TABLE_NAME`: The table where events data of the user will be stored by awarder. This should be unique per kafka cluster.
        
- `BADGES_TABLE_NAME`: The table where all previously awarded badges for the user will stored by the awarder.This should be unique per kafka cluster

If Event Listener application is not behind the firewall, the hostname of the 'event-listener-route' Route on the OpenShift Cluster will be the `LUDUS_URL`. This can be used to configure the webhooks 

If Event Listener application is behind the firewall, we need to configure [ultrahook](http://www.ultrahook.com/faq) to receive webhooks behind the firewall. Register and get your `ULTRAHOOK_API_KEY` [here](http://www.ultrahook.com/register). Please remember the `WEBHOOK_NAMESPACE`. This will be unique for your ultrahook account.


To deploy Ultrahook on an OpenShift cluster use the following command with required parameters:
        
```
oc process -f openshift/ludus.ultrahook.deployment.template.yaml -p ULTRAHOOK_API_KEY=`echo -n "<ultrahook_api_key>" | base64` ULTRAHOOK_SUBDOMAIN=<ultrahook_subdomain> ULTRAHOOK_DESTINATION=<event_listener_hostname> | oc apply -f -
```

- `ULTRAHOOK_API_KEY`: The api key unique to each ultrahook account

- `ULTRAHOOK_SUBDOMAIN`: A subdomain of your namespace
- `ULTRAHOOK_DESTINATION`: The hostname of the 'event-listener-route' Route on OpenShift cluster

If you registered your account with the 'ludus.ultrahook.com' as your `WEBHOOK_NAMESPACE` and later deployed the ultrahook with `ULTRAHOOK_SUBDOMAIN` as 'redhat', your `LUDUS_URL`will be 'http://redhat.ludus.ultrahook.com'

### How to configure github and trello webhooks?

To set up a github webhook, go to the settings page of your repository or organization. From there, click Webhooks, then Add webhook. Now enter/configure following details:

- `Payload URL`: `LUDUS_URL`
- `Content type`: application/json
- `Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?`: Send me everything
  
To set up a trello webhook, please follow the instructions given [here](https://developers.trello.com/page/webhooks).
